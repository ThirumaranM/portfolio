			'Developed automation workflows for a research-driven application focused on identifying good and bad bacteria in human samples. Implemented CI/CD pipelines to streamline the data ingestion, processing, and deployment lifecycle. Utilized AWS services such as Lambda, S3, and Batch to automate data extraction, transformation, and storage. Integrated machine learning models for bacterial classification to support real-time analysis. Ensured the entire workflow was scalable, secure, and optimized for performance in a fully cloud-native environment.',

			'We leverage AWS DevOps practices to automate the entire software delivery process by creating a robust CI/CD pipeline that integrates GitHub with AWS EC2, enabling seamless, rapid, and reliable deployment of our production application and MySQL database. This automation ensures consistent builds, testing, and deployment with minimal manual intervention, improving agility and operational efficiency. At the same time, we prioritize AWS Security by embedding continuous vulnerability scanning and monitoring within our AWS environments to proactively detect and remediate security risks. Using services like Amazon Inspector, AWS Security Hub, and GuardDuty, we identify potential vulnerabilities and suspicious activities, enforcing strict access controls, encryption, and compliance policies to protect our critical infrastructure and data. Together, these DevOps and Security measures ensure fast, safe, and resilient application delivery on AWS.',

			'Designed and implemented the backend infrastructure for a feature-rich astrology platform supporting mobile OTP and SSO authentication (Google, Apple), masterâ€“child profile hierarchy, multilingual inference delivery, and encrypted personal data management. The system includes per-user API quota tracking, dynamic push notifications based on astrological events, and an internal Karma Points (KPoints) credit system to manage in-app purchases and AI interactions. Integrated third-party astrology services through proxy APIs while minimizing costs via static data caching. Also enabled real-time language translation using Amazon Translate, PDF report generation and storage, friend linking for compatibility features, and feedback tracking for AI-generated responses.',
